# Core-Java-Project
Java offers the real possibility that most programs can be written in a type-safe language. However, for Java to be broadly useful, it needs to have more expressive power than it does at present. It extends Java with a mechanism for parametric polymorphism, which allows the definition and implementation of generic abstractions. It gives a complete design for the extended language. It also explains how to implement the various object oriented concepts.. Our implementation avoids these performance problems. Abstractions are not the only extension needed to make Java into a convenient programming language. First-class procedures and iterators would also be valuable extensions to the language. We study the various cocepts of core java and performed practicals. It provied good and impactful concepts in programming lanuges.
